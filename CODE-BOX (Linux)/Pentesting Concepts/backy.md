backy.sh is a lightweight shell script designed to back up directories and files using standard Unix tools like rsync and tar. It operates based on a JSON configuration file (task.json) that specifies:​

Directories to synchronize and archive: You can specify any directories or files you wish to back up.

Backup frequency: Options include hourly, daily, monthly, etc.

Exclusion patterns: Define patterns for files or directories to exclude from the backup.

Destination path: Specify where the backups should be stored.

Optional multiprocessing: Enhance performance by enabling multiprocessing.​

To use backy.sh, you would typically run:​

bash
Copy
Edit
backy task.json
This command reads the task.json configuration and performs the backup accordingly.​
