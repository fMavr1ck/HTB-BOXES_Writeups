SQLAlchemy ORM vs. Raw SQL: Key Differences
Understanding the difference between SQLAlchemy's ORM and raw SQL is crucial for effective database programming. Here's a detailed comparison:

1. Fundamental Approach
Raw SQL:

You write literal SQL queries as strings

Directly interacts with database tables

Results are typically returned as tuples or dictionaries

python
# Raw SQL example
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s", (user_id,))
row = cursor.fetchone()
SQLAlchemy ORM:

Maps database tables to Python classes

Interacts with Python objects instead of direct SQL

Results are returned as Python objects

python
# ORM example
user = session.query(User).filter_by(id=user_id).f
